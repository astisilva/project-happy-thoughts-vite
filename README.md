# Unhappy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project
I started by sketching, to easier see what I needed to do.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

- I started by looking at the sketch I made to see what was needed to be done, and with help from the lessons I started to build the project bit by bit. I had som issues which I googled to be able to solve the problem. In this project I used React features such as useState, useEffect, and the Fetch API for dynamic and responsive functionality.
